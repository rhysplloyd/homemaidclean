            <h3>About Us</h3>

            <p>My name is Tracy. After working at the NNUH as a health care assistant on the stroke unit, I decided I wanted to start my very own business where I could continue to help people. In March 2020 ‘Home Maid Clean’ started business. It was a strange year to start due to the pandemic which hit the world with the sad loss of many lives. We were one of the lucky small businesses that could continue to work and build to where we are today.</p>

            <p>I will always remember my very first customers; a lovely couple called Mr and Mrs B. It was so rewarding knowing that I was helping them. Their family lived a distance away, so it was also a reassurance to them that someone was close by to help when they could not get there, especially during the pandemic.</p>

            <p>At home maid clean we take great pride in our work, putting 100% into everything we do and always putting our customers’ needs first.</p>

            <p>When cleaning, we like to use our own equipment and eco-friendly products to ensure we get the best results.</p>

            <p>We are fully insured, and DBS checked.</p>
